Cloudscope is a node.js web app to get your horoscope for today and the last 7 days.

The home page is a menu of animated zodiac signs you can select from. The image
links are retrieved randomly from free zodiac image sources defined in the app.
You can refresh the animations to get a new random display using "zAp".

Horoscopes are retrieved from a free horoscope web service. Sorry, the service 
doesn't let us get horoscopes in the future :p
